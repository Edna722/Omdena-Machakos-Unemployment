# Omdena-Machakos-Unemployment
*This project aims to analyze the unemployment landscape in Machakos, Kenya, and explore solutions to help reduce unemployment rates through data-driven insights and strategic interventions. 
* By leveraging machine learning, data analysis, and other data-driven approaches, we aim to provide actionable insights for local governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders to develop better policies and programs aimed at reducing unemployment in the region.

## Project Overview
* The unemployment rate in Machakos, a region in Kenya, continues to be a pressing issue, with many young people struggling to find employment.
* This project seeks to understand the key factors contributing to unemployment and provide recommendations to alleviate this challenge.

## Key Goals:
* Analyze unemployment trends and key factors contributing to joblessness in Machakos.
* Develop predictive models to identify factors that influence unemployment rates.
* Provide recommendations for stakeholders on how to effectively reduce unemployment.
* Provide insights on job creation, skill development, and economic growth opportunities in the region.

## Problem Statement
* Unemployment in Machakos is a major challenge, particularly for youth, leading to economic instability and a lack of opportunities for personal growth and community development. The project seeks to:

## Understand the underlying causes of unemployment in the region.
* Identify economic trends and areas where interventions can create jobs.
* Design data-driven solutions to optimize resources and implement targeted actions.

## Data Sources
The project uses multiple data sources to understand unemployment patterns and job market conditions in Machakos. These include:
* Local Government Employment Data: Data on unemployment rates, demographics, and education levels.
* Survey Data: Collected data through local surveys to understand citizensâ€™ employment status, challenges, and aspirations.
* Economic Data: National and regional economic performance data, including industry growth, investment opportunities, and sectoral employment trends.
* Job Market Data: Listings of job openings, recruitment trends, and employer demands from online job boards.

## Methodology
The methodology used in this project involves:
* Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gathering relevant datasets from local government sources, surveys, and other economic data, followed by cleaning and preprocessing.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data through statistical analysis and visualizations to identify patterns and key factors influencing unemployment.
* Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression to predict unemployment trends and identify risk factors.
* Recommendation Engine: Designing a system to recommend effective policies or interventions to stakeholders based on the analysis.
* Visualization: Creating interactive dashboards and reports for better understanding and communication of the findings.

## Technologies Used
* Python: For data analysis, machine learning, and model development.
* Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and cleaning.
* Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and predictive analytics.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and creating insightful plots.
* Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and sharing insights.
* Tableau/Power BI: For building interactive dashboards and visual reports (if applicable).

## Project Pipeline
Data Collection:
* Gather datasets from various sources, including local government and public data repositories.
* Collect additional survey data from local communities.
* Data Preprocessing:
* Clean, format, and handle missing data.
* Transform data into a suitable format for analysis and modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
* Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to understand key trends.
* Identify important features contributing to unemployment.

Model Development:
* Develop machine learning models to predict factors influencing unemployment.
* Evaluate models and choose the best-performing one based on accuracy and interpretability.

Visualization & Reporting:
* Create visual reports and dashboards to communicate findings effectively.
* Provide actionable insights and recommendations for policy development.

Expected Outcomes
By the end of this project, we expect to achieve:
* A comprehensive report on the state of unemployment in Machakos, highlighting key contributing factors.
* Predictive models that can forecast unemployment trends and identify high-risk factors.
* A recommendation system offering actionable suggestions for local stakeholders to create jobs and reduce unemployment.
